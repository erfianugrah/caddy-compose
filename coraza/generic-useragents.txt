# Generic HTTP library User-Agent substrings.
# Matched via @pmFromFile (case-insensitive substring match).
# Rule ID: 9100035 in pre-crs.conf
#
# These are default UAs for common HTTP libraries. Legitimate services
# (webhooks, monitoring, CI/CD) often use them. Instead of dropping,
# we add +5 anomaly score. Combined with other heuristic signals
# (missing Accept, empty Referer, etc.), automated tools still get
# blocked via CRS anomaly threshold — but legitimate single-signal
# requests pass through.
